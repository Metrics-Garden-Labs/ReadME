# Welcome to Metrics Garden Labs 

The problem we're solving for is the poor allocation of Public Goods funding due to the lack of predetermined useful and verifiable metrics that can be used to measure the impact Public Goods (OSS, Community, Education, Dev Experience, Governance contributions) are having in the web3 ecosystem and through this generate data that can then be evaluated.

Solution:
The solution is a platform that enables the adoption of standardized on-chain metrics through the use of Attestations for contributions to the Optimism Collective. By developing a complex network of schemas targeting specific contribution types that are used through an intuitive interface, users will be guided to select the metrics that best fit their contribution types. This will ensure that the process of evaluating and demonstrating impact is transparent, efficient, verifiable, and standardized to be easily included in funding decisions.
